# liri-node-app
1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
* We want to create a command line app using node that will allow users to either find concerts, get spotify details, or movie details.
2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
The app runs mainly from liri.js and uses axios, node-spotify-api, dotenv, fs packages.
3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
The app runs via the command line. First you need to make a .env file with your spotify keys:
```
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret
```
4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
Please see the demo_clip included in the repo
